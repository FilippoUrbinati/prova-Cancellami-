S 1 GENERAL RULES
S1.1 Vehicle Condition
S1.1.1 Vehicles must be presented for judging in finished condition, fully assembled, complete and
ready-to-race.
S1.1.2 The judges will not evaluate any vehicle that is presented in what they consider to be an
unfinished state.
S1.1.3 Vehicles may be presented for judging without having passed Technical Inspection, even if
final tuning and setup is in progress.
S1.1.4 Covers and/or parts may be removed during the judging to facilitate access and presentation
of components or concepts.
S 2 BUSINESS PLAN PRESENTATION (BPP)
S2.1 Business Plan Presentation Objective
S2.1.1 The objective of the BPP is to assess the team’s ability to develop, present and defend a
comprehensive business model in an investment round scenario. The business model must
offer a product or a service integrating the team’s specific prototype vehicle or a specific
component of it. The business model must be for-profit and provide a rewarding business
opportunity. Therefore, non-profit organisations are not permitted.
S2.1.2 The following are not eligible as components of the team’s current prototype vehicle for the
creation of the business model:
• Consumables and fasteners
• Offcuts, scrap, or other by-products arising from the manufacturing process
• Tooling or tools used in the manufacturing process
• Off-vehicle infrastructure or equipment not permanently integrated into the vehicle
• Test, measurement, and calibration equipment not permanently integrated into the
vehicle
• Personal protective equipment and driver apparel
• Standalone services, data, or cloud solutions that do not rely on a team-developed
on-vehicle component or software
• Using, rebranding, or reselling bought parts without the team’s involvement in design,
production, or further processing
Formula Student Rules 2026 Version: 1.0 110 of 135
S2 Business Plan Presentation (BPP)
• Items that are not part of the team’s current prototype vehicle
S2.1.3 During the presentation, teams must explicitly show how they derived their proposed product
or service from the team’s current prototype vehicle.
S2.1.4 The judges should be treated as if they were potential investors or partners for the presented
business model. A team may assign the judges specific roles for their BPP, i.e. as representatives of a specific company as strategic investors. Nonetheless, these roles have to allow the
judges to pose as potential investors or partners.
S2.1.5 The quality of the actual prototype will not be considered as part of the BPP judging, therefore
S1.1 does not apply.
S2.2 Business Plan Presentation Procedure
S2.2.1 Presentations are limited to a maximum of 10 min. Anything presented after the 10 min time
limit will not be considered for the scoring. The judges may stop any presentation exceeding
10 min.
S2.2.2 The presentation will not be interrupted by questions. Immediately following the presentation
there will be a question and answer session.
S2.2.3 One or more team members may present the business plan.
S2.2.4 All team members involved in the BPP must be in the podium area and must be introduced to
the judges at the beginning of the presentation. The team members who have been introduced
may answer the judges’ questions even if they were not actually presenting.
S2.2.5 Handouts, prototypes, or other supporting material will only be evaluated if explicitly
referenced during the presentation or Q&A. All items must be removed by the team after
their presentation.
S2.2.6 Before the competition a specific deep dive topic, which has to be part of the 10 min
presentation, will be published on the competition website.
S2.3 Executive & Financial Summary
S2.3.1 To prepare the potential investors or partners for your team’s upcoming presentation, it is
required that a Business Plan Executive & Financial Summary (BPEFS) is submitted before
the competition.
S2.3.2 Further requirements regarding the BPEFS will be published on the competition website on
the date specified in the Competition Handbook.
S2.3.3 The BPEFS must be submitted online in PDF format via the competition website, not later
than the deadline specified in the Competition Handbook.

15 penaltypoints will be deducted from the team’s BPP scoring.
S2.4.3 The judging at the competition will start with an initial judging, where all teams are judged
by different judging groups.
S2.4.4 Some teams may be chosen to participate in the BPP finals to determine the BPP winner.
The BPP finals will be held separately from the initial judging and teams will be informed
about their participation during the competition.
S2.4.5 The scoring of the BPP is based on the average of the scores given by each of the judges.
S2.4.6 The scoring for the non-finalist is calculated as followed:
BPP_SCORE = 70
Pteam
Pmax 
Pteam is the score awarded to the team
Pmax is the highest score awarded to any team not participating in the finals
S2.4.7 The scoring of the BPP finalists will vary from 75 to 71 points and is scored immediately
after the BPP finals by all judges.
S 3 COST AND MANUFACTURING
S3.1 Cost and Manufacturing Objective
S3.1.1 The objective of Cost and Manufacturing is to evaluate the team’s understanding of the manufacturing processes, costs and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the construction of
a prototype vehicle. This includes trade off decisions between content and cost, make or buy
decisions and understanding the differences between prototype and mass production.
Formula Student Rules 2026 Version: 1.0 112 of 135
S3 Cost and Manufacturing
S3.2 Cost and Manufacturing Procedure
S3.2.1 Prior to the competition, three CRD, see S3.3, must be submitted to the competition website
by the deadline specified in the Competition Handbook.
S3.2.2 During the competition, a discussion with the judges will take place, next to the team’s
vehicle. The discussion is split into three parts:
S3.2.3 Part 1 “BOM Discussion”:
A discussion to evaluate the team’s ability to prepare an accurate engineering and manufacturing BOM for the complete vehicle. The team must prove the following:
• The specification of the vehicle in the CRD accurately reflects the vehicle brought to
the competition.
• The costs and emissions within the CCBOM part of the BOM are correct and realistic.
• The manufacturing feasibility of the vehicle.
S3.2.4 Part 2 “Cost Understanding”:
A discussion to evaluate the general Cost and Manufacturing knowledge of the team.
S3.2.5 Part 3 “Real Case”:
A specific task to evaluate the Cost and Manufacturing knowledge in a certain field. The real
case task will be published on the competition website before the competition.
S3.2.6 Teams are allowed to bring electronic, handwritten or printed handouts, flip charts or similar,
but the space available may be limited.
S3.3 Cost Report Documents (CRD)
S3.3.1 The CRD consist of the following documents:
• The BOM, including CCBOM, created and submitted online on the competition
website
• The Supporting Material File, submitted as a pdf file to the competition website
• The Cost and Emissions Explanation File, submitted as a PDF file to to the competition
website
S3.3.2 A changelog of the changes on the vehicle since the submission deadline of the CRD can be
presented to the judges at the BOM discussion as a separate document. Missing parts of the
BOM cannot be part of the changelog.
S3.3.3 All CRD must be brought either as hard copy or as digital version.
S3.3.4 The website tool will provide a printable pdf version of the BOM.
S3.3.5 The team must ensure that at least two judges are able to review the CRD independently.
S3.3.6 The presented CRD must be identical to the submitted versions, otherwise 0 points will be
scored for the “BOM Discussion” part.
Formula Student Rules 2026 Version: 1.0 113 of 135
S3 Cost and Manufacturing
S3.4 Bill of Material (BOM)
S3.4.1 The BOM is a sorted list of all vehicle parts.
S3.4.2 The BOM is structured as follows:
• The BOM is broken down into “systems”, see S3.4.7.
• Each “system” is broken down into “assemblies”, which are defined by the website
tool.
• Each “assembly” can optionally be broken down into “sub-assemblies”, which must
be defined by the team.
• Each “assembly” or “sub-assembly” is broken down into “parts”, which must be
defined by the team.
S3.4.3 The BOM must list all parts fitted to the prototype vehicle at any time during the competition.
S3.4.4 Only dry tires and wheels per T2.7.1 need to be included in the BOM.
S3.4.5 “Fasteners” are additional items necessary to assemble a “part” or “(sub-)assembly” and
should not be listed.
• Examples for “fasteners”:
DIN-931 hexagon screws, glue, zip ties, tape used for mounting or fixing, . . .
• Examples that are considered “parts” and not “fasteners”:
Tape used for edge protection, safety wire, . . .
S3.4.6 A self-manufactured “fastener” is considered a “part”.
S3.4.7 The “systems” are:
• Autonomous System
• Brake System
• Chassis and Body
• Drivetrain
• Engine and Tractive System
• Grounded Low Voltage System
• Miscellaneous, Fit and Finish
• Steering System
• Suspension System
• Wheels, Wheel Bearings and Tires
S3.4.8 When adding “parts” to the BOM, the comments section should be reviewed thoroughly.
The chosen part name must clearly describe what is included. For example, if a spring is
included, the “part” should not be called “damper”.
S3.4.9 Only metric units must be used within the BOM.
Formula Student Rules 2026 Version: 1.0 114 of 135
S3 Cost and Manufacturing
S3.5 Costed Carbonized Bill of Material (CCBOM)
S3.5.1 The manufacturing and assembly processes, realistic costs and greenhouse gas emissions of
all parts from one or two systems of the BOM must be listed in the CCBOM.
S3.5.2 For 2026, a CCBOM for the “Engine and Tractive System” must be submitted.
S3.5.3 Additional to the BOM, the CCBOM must:
• Include the actual associated manufacturing processes for each part as used for the
prototype vehicle.
• Include tooling (e.g. welding jigs, molds, patterns and dies).
• Include the actual costs of materials, fabrication, bought parts and assembly for each
part as used for the prototype vehicle.
• Include the system’s carbon footprint for each part, manufacturing and assembly
process of the prototype vehicle in CO2e in kg.
S3.5.4 Each constituent “part” of an “assembly” must be classified as “bought” or “made”.
S3.5.5 Additional to the structure of the BOM, in the CCBOM each “part” is broken down into
• “materials” used (e.g. aluminium)
• “processes” that describe the necessary steps for manufacturing
• “fasteners” used to assemble the part (if applicable)
• “tooling” required for manufacturing (if applicable)
• “overhead” for additional associated costs and emissions of manufacturing and assembly of a part that are not covered by the points above
S3.5.6 “Tooling” is the necessary tools used for transforming the “material” into the desired shape.
If production tooling is associated with processes that are specific to the part geometry, it
must be included. For example the dies to stamp out a chassis bracket are tooling.
S3.5.7 Hand or power tools must not be included.
S3.5.8 For “bought parts”, only fasteners have to be included (if applicable). Fasteners themselves
are not considered bought parts. If the part was modified, the associated “processes” and
“tooling” (if applicable) for this modification must also be included.
S3.5.9 A modified bought part is considered a make part, where the bought part acts as the material.
Associated “processes”, “tooling”, “fasteners” and “overhead” (if applicable) for the modifications must be included. However, the “carbon footprint” of the bought part itself should
not be considered.
S3.5.10 Only parts that can be bought from a catalog may be designated as “bought parts”.
S3.5.11 The cost calculations must be completed as realistically as possible and exclude research,
development and capital expenditures for real estates (e.g. plant or development hours of the
team).
S3.5.12 All costs must be displayed in EUR. For calculating the prices in EUR from other currencies,
the team must provide the exchange rates used.
S3.5.13 There is no maximum cost. Receipts are not required for any items.
Formula Student Rules 2026 Version: 1.0 115 of 135
S3 Cost and Manufacturing
S3.5.14 The calculations for machine hourly rates, wages (including overheads) etc. must be shown.
S3.5.15 The “carbon footprint” is calculated in CO2e based on a “Cradle-to-Gate” Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA) of the selected “system(s)”.
S3.5.16 The “Cradle-to-Gate” analysis includes extraction of raw materials needed, manufacturing of
“made parts”, “sub-assemblies” and “assemblies” as well as manufacturing of the “system”
(ready to be mounted into the final prototype vehicle).
S3.5.17 The “carbon footprint” for the the transportation between the steps must be included.
S3.5.18 The “carbon footprint” must exclude research and development.
S3.6 Supporting Material File
S3.6.1 The Supporting Material File is a document containing additional information which allows
the judges to understand the BOM. It may include drawings, exploded view drawings and/or
pictures of the vehicle and the parts included in the BOM.
S3.7 Cost and Emissions Explanation File
S3.7.1 The Cost and Emissions Explanation File is a document which allows the judges to understand the costs and greenhouse gas emissions within the CCBOM part of the BOM.
S3.7.2 The cost model used must be pointed out, especially which specific costs are included, e.g.
machine operation costs.
S3.7.3 The methodology used for determining the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in CO2e also
needs to be explained. The specific carbon emission factors associates with e.g one material
type need to be included.
S3.8 Cost and Manufacturing Scoring
S3.8.1 The team must present their vehicle according to S1.1 to score points in Cost and Manufacturing.
S3.8.2 Cost and Manufacturing will be evaluated on the categories specified in the following table:
Category Points
Part 1 “BOM Discussion” 50
Part 2 “Cost Understanding” 25
Part 3 “Real Case” 25
Total 100
S3.8.3 If items are missing from the BOM, points are deducted until 0 points are scored for “BOM
Discussion”.
S3.8.4 Some teams may be chosen to participate in the Cost and Manufacturing finals to determine
the Cost and Manufacturing winner. The Cost and Manufacturing finals will be held separately from the initial judging and teams will be informed about their participation during
the competition.

S4 Engineering Design
S3.8.5 In case of finals the highest achievable scoring for the non-finalists is 80 points.
S 4 ENGINEERING DESIGN
S4.1 Engineering Design Objective
S4.1.1 The concept of the Engineering Design is to evaluate the student’s engineering process and
effort that went into the design of a vehicle, meeting the intent of the competition.
S4.1.2 Proprietary components and systems that are incorporated into the vehicle design as finished
items are not evaluated as a student designed unit, but are only assessed on the team’s
selection and application of that unit.
S4.1.3 An evaluation concerning the capability of the vehicle to drive autonomously will also be
part of this discipline. Therefore, all systems that are required to drive autonomously will be
investigated. This also includes a discussion about the hardware and the software used in the
AS.
S4.2 Technical Vehicle System Documentation (TVSD)
S4.2.1 The TVSD should provide the judges with a structured overview of the vehicle and the
team’s design approach. The level of detail must allow the evaluation of design decisions,
engineering methods, and validation procedures according to the engineering categories
listed in table 7. Any information required to scope, explain or highlight design features,
concepts, methods or objectives that demonstrate the value and performance of the vehicle
should be included at the team’s discretion.
S4.2.2 A completed TVSD must be submitted online via the competition website, not later than the
deadline specified in the Competition Handbook.
S4.2.3 The TVSD must include three technical drawings (no renderings) showing the vehicle from
the front, top and side. Each drawing must contain the overall vehicle dimensions (length,
width, and height) clearly annotated at least once.
S4.2.4 The TVSD will be used to sort the teams into appropriate Engineering Design queues and to
support the evaluation during Engineering Design.
S4.2.5 Any evidence or supplementary documentation referenced in the TVSD must be available at
the competition and presented to the judges upon request.
S4.3 Engineering Design Procedure
S4.3.1 Engineering Design starts with the submission of the TVSD and its review.
S4.3.2 At the competition, teams will present their knowledge and their vehicle to the judges, which
will evaluate the team’s performance following the design objectives stated in chapter S4.1.
S4.3.3 Some teams may be chosen to participate in the Engineering Design finals to determine the
Engineering Design winner. The Engineering Design finals will be held separately from the
initial judging and teams will be informed about their participation during the competition.

will be adapted, see table 8, and there will be more judges during the normal presentation
focusing on the AS.
S4.3.8 [DC ONLY] There will be separate Engineering Design finals for the DC.
S4.4 Engineering Design Judging Criteria
S4.4.1 The judges will evaluate the engineering effort based upon the team’s TVSD, responses to
questions and an inspection of the vehicle.
S4.4.2 The judges will inspect the vehicle to determine if the design concepts are adequate and
appropriate for the application (relative to the objectives set forth in the rules).
S4.4.3 The judges may deduct points if the team cannot adequately explain the engineering and
construction of the vehicle.
S4.5 Engineering Design Scoring
S4.5.1 The team must present their vehicle according to S1.1 to score points in Engineering Design.
